For the past two years, I have been working on my own larger project, HungryScan, which focuses on simplifying the configuration of interactive digital menus for restaurants. I also experiment with various CI/CD technologies, set up my own containers on Railway, and try to integrate everything with Jenkins. I also find time for other activities. When I step away from my desk, I go for a run! I run every two days, averaging 7 km per session, and on non-running days, I do strength training using resistance bands and bodyweight exercises.",
